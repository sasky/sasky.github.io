            <h2>About </h2>
            <p>Hello, I have been building things on the Web for a few years now. I currently work as an in house developer
                for
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hpacademy.com/">hpacademy.com</a>. I do occasional side hussle work. Usually
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.silverstripe.org/">Silverstripe</a> related things.
            </p>
            <h3>Technologies I like</h3>
            <p>My bread and butter is working with the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.silverstripe.org/"> Silverstripe</a> ( a very underrated PHP framework/CMS ). I have built many small and big things in Silverstripe
                over the years. I also love
                <a target="" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
                <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Work History</h3>
            <p> I work as an in house full stack developer. I maintain a horizontally scaled LEMP server stack, I code up new
                functionality using TDD. I make sure the website is making money daily. Previously I have worked at
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.swordfox.nz/">swordfox.nz</a>, a website/design agency; and a few more employers before that.

            </p>
            <h2>Recent Interesting Projects </h2>
            <h3>HP Academy - Promotional Webinar System</h3>
            <p>HPA needed a well-tuned webinar system as part of their main sales strategy. The idea is to get people (mainly
                via Facebook Marketing) to sign up to a Webinar running later in the week. As well as reminder emails, the
                attendee has the option to opt in for TXT and browser notifications for when the Webinar is about to start.
                When the webinar is live, the attendees can use the custom built live chat to ask the host questions. At
                the end of the webinar the sales pitch is given, and a custom link is inserted into the chat for the attendees
                to buy the special deals. After the Webinar, the name and emails of the Attendees are sent to a CRM for a
                tad more marketing.</p>
            <p>I built this using a few Cron jobs, a fair chunk of well tested backend Silverstripe code, integration with a
                few API’s for the TXT’s CRM’s etc, and built a custom Node.js chat server.</p>

            <h3>HP Academy - Payment Plan System</h3>
            <p>HPA wanted to experiment with offering customers different payment plans which would allow the customer to pay
                for the product over a number of weeks. It would need to work with both DPS and Paypal, and the support team
                would need to be kept in the loop if payments had been missed.</p>
            <p>To accomplish this I built a system where payments due for the week are processed overnight. Failed payments
                are tried three more times over the following nights before the products are removed from the customer’s
                account. The support team is also emailed about failing payments so they can work something out with the
                customer. The payment plans are automatically marked as complete when all payments have been made.</p>
            <h3>Iconic Motorhomes - Motorhome Hire Availability/ Booking Form</h3>
            <p>Iconic had a website but just had a basic enquiry form. The admin of getting back to potential customers about
                the availability, and rates or their different types of campervans was becoming overwhelming. They needed
                a more robust availability form that saved on admin, and helped the customer get a quicker idea of what vans
                were available and for what price.</p>
            <p>There is some quite complex business logic going on under the hood, as each van has dates where it is not available,
                and daily rates which take the time of year and number of people into account when generating the price.</p>
