            <h2> About </h2>
            <p>Hello, I have been building things on the Web for a few years now. I currently work as an in house developer
                for
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hpacademy.com/">hpacademy.com</a>. I do occasional side hussle work. Usually
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.silverstripe.org/">Silverstripe</a> related things.
            </p>
            <h2> Technologies I like</h2>
            <p>My bread and butter is working with the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.silverstripe.org/"> Silverstripe</a> ( a very underrated PHP framework/CMS ). I have built many small and big things in Silverstripe
                over the years. I also love
                <a target="" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
                <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>
            </p>
            <h2> Work/ed History</h2>
            <p> I work as an in house full stack developer. I maintain a horizontally scaled LEMP server stack, I code up new
                functionality using TDD. I make sure the website is making money daily. Previously I have worked at
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.swordfox.nz/">swordfox.nz</a>, a website/design agency; and a few more employers before that.
